# Background Context
Environment variables will be your best friend for this project!

* `HBNB_ENV`: running environment. It can be “dev” or “test” for the moment (“production” soon!)
* `HBNB_MYSQL_USER`: the username of your MySQL
* `HBNB_MYSQL_PWD`: the password of your MySQL
* `HBNB_MYSQL_HOST`: the hostname of your MySQL
* `HBNB_MYSQL_DB`: the database name of your MySQL
* `HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE`: the type of storage used. It can be “file” (using `FileStorage`) or `db` (using `DBStorage`)

* What is `*args` and how to use it
* What is `**kwargs` and how to use it
* How to handle named arguments in a function
* How to create a MySQL database
* How to create a MySQL user and grant it privileges
* What ORM means
* How to map a Python Class to a MySQL table
* How to handle 2 different storage engines with the same codebase
* How to use environment variables

# Copyright - Plagiarism
* You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
* You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.
* You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
* Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

#vRequirements
Python Scripts
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
* All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
* All your classes should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

# Python Unit Tests
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files should end with a new line
* All your test files should be inside a folder `tests`
* You have to use the unittest module
* All your test files should be python files (extension: `.py`)
* All your test files and folders should start by `test_`
* Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project: ex: for `models/base_model.py`, unit tests must be in: `tests/test_models/test_base_model.py`
* All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m unittest discover tests`
* You can also test file by file by using this command: `python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py`
* All your modules should have documentation `(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
* All your classes should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
* We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge cases

# SQL Scripts
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be executed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `MySQL 8.0`
* Your files will be executed with `SQLAlchemy` version `1.4.x`
* All your files should end with a new line
* All your SQL queries should have a comment just before (i.e. syntax above)
* All your files should start by a comment describing the task
* All SQL keywords should be in uppercase (`SELECT`, `WHERE`…)
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
