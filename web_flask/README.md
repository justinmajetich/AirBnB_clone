# In this repository we perform the tasks of AIRBNB_CLONE_V2/web_flask
## It has the following tasks

- Write a script that starts a Flask web application:

Your web application must be listening on 0.0.0.0, port 5000
Routes:
/: display “Hello HBNB!”
You must use the option strict_slashes=False in your route definition

- Write a script that starts a Flask web application:

H1 tag: “Number: n is even|odd” inside the tag BODY
You must use the option strict_slashes=False in your route definition

- Before using Flask to display our HBNB data, you will need to update some part of our engine:

Update FileStorage: (models/engine/file_storage.py)

Add a public method def close(self):: call reload() method for deserializing the JSON file to objects
Update DBStorage: (models/engine/db_storage.py)

Add a public method def close(self):: call remove() method on the private session attribute (self.__session) tips or close() on the class Session tips
Update State: (models/state.py) - If it’s not already present

If your storage engine is not DBStorage, add a public getter method cities to return the list of City objects from storage linked to the current State

- Write a script that starts a Flask web application:

Your web application must be listening on 0.0.0.0, port 5000
You must use storage for fetching data from the storage engine (FileStorage or DBStorage) => from models import storage and storage.all(...)
After each request you must remove the current SQLAlchemy Session:
Declare a method to handle @app.teardown_appcontext
Call in this method storage.close()
Routes:
/states_list: display a HTML page: (inside the tag BODY)
H1 tag: “States”
UL tag: with the list of all State objects present in DBStorage sorted by name (A->Z) tip
LI tag: description of one State: <state.id>: <B><state.name></B>
Import this 7-dump to have some data
You must use the option strict_slashes=False in your route definition
IMPORTANT

Make sure you have a running and valid setup_mysql_dev.sql in your AirBnB_clone_v2 repository (Task)
Make sure all tables are created when you run echo "quit" | HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_dev HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_dev_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_dev_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db ./console.py

- Write a script that starts a Flask web application:

Your web application must be listening on 0.0.0.0, port 5000
You must use storage for fetching data from the storage engine (FileStorage or DBStorage) => from models import storage and storage.all(...)
To load all cities of a State:
If your storage engine is DBStorage, you must use cities relationship
Otherwise, use the public getter method cities
After each request you must remove the current SQLAlchemy Session:
Declare a method to handle @app.teardown_appcontext
Call in this method storage.close()
Routes:
/cities_by_states: display a HTML page: (inside the tag BODY)
H1 tag: “States”
UL tag: with the list of all State objects present in DBStorage sorted by name (A->Z) tip
LI tag: description of one State: <state.id>: <B><state.name></B> + UL tag: with the list of City objects linked to the State sorted by name (A->Z)
LI tag: description of one City: <city.id>: <B><city.name></B>

You must use the option strict_slashes=False in your route definition

If a State object is found with this id:
H1 tag: “State: ”
H3 tag: “Cities:”
UL tag: with the list of City objects linked to the State sorted by name (A->Z)
LI tag: description of one City: <city.id>: <B><city.name></B>

/hbnb_filters: display a HTML page like 6-index.html, which was done during the project 0x01. AirBnB clone - Web static
Copy files 3-footer.css, 3-header.css, 4-common.css and 6-filters.css from web_static/styles/ to the folder web_flask/static/styles
Copy files icon.png and logo.png from web_static/images/ to the folder web_flask/static/images
Update .popover class in 6-filters.css to allow scrolling in the popover and a max height of 300 pixels.
Use 6-index.html content as source code for the template 10-hbnb_filters.html:
Replace the content of the H4 tag under each filter title (H3 States and H3 Amenities) by &nbsp;
State, City and Amenity objects must be loaded from DBStorage and sorted by name (A->Z)
